# Medical-X-Ray-Image-Classifier---Pneumonia-Detection
This project involves building a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify medical X-ray images and detect pneumonia.

# Project Overview
This project involves building a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify medical X-ray images and detect pneumonia. Targeted at beginner to intermediate-level data scientists, the project will focus on leveraging deep learning techniques to develop a robust classification model. The final model will be deployed using Streamlit, providing a user-friendly interface for real-time predictions.

# Project Objectives
Dataset Acquisition and Preprocessing:
* Use the publicly available dataset of X-ray images for model training.
* Perform data preprocessing, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation, to prepare the images for training.
  
# Model Development:
* Build a convolutional neural network (CNN) using deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
* Train and evaluate the model to classify X-ray images as normal or pneumonia.
  
# Model Deployment:
* Develop a Streamlit application to allow users to upload X-ray images and receive a prediction.
* Include visualization of prediction confidence and model explanation (e.g., Grad-CAM).
  
# Technical Requirements
Tools and Libraries:
* Dataset Handling: Pandas, NumPy.
* Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow or PyTorch.
